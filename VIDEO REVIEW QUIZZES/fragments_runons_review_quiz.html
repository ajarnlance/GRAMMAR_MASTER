                correct: 2,
                explanation: "<span class='highlight'>'The test was difficult, so I studied all night'</span> is correct because it uses a comma + coordinating conjunction (FANBOYS) to properly join the two complete sentences. Option A is a comma splice (just a comma without a conjunction). The conjunction 'so' shows the relationship between the ideas - the difficult test caused the studying."
